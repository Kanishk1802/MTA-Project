## How It Works

This tool provides an overview of approx safety ratings for subway stations in NYC using data provided from the MTA and NYPD.

Subway stations are mapped based on their location and matched with reported crimes within 200 meters to estimate crime levels near each station.


## How to Use This Tool

- Use the "Explore All NYC Stations' page to explore safety ratings/stats for all stations across NYC.
- Use the "Explore Your Commute" page to explore details specific to travel between two stations.
- Use the links in the map tool tip or data-tables to explore the crime data page for a specific station.

## Important Note
This tool is for exploratory purposes only an to serve as a proxy! The relative safety of subway stations depends on many constantly changing factors.
